# searching-algorithm-binary-search-and-hashing
Experimental setup
In our Python experimental setup, we can use UTF-8 mode for Afan Oromo text file
reading in python. The iterative approach is used for implementing the binary searching algorithm.
The proposed Approach search of a phrase in a large original text file using hashing and python is
demonstrated. The following table describe the hardware, software specification we want to use
for implementing the experimental setup.
